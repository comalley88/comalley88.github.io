            <h1>Origins</h1>
        <p>The idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which featured Kristy Swanson in the title role. The director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, saw it as a "pop culture comedy about what people think about vampires"

                "I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing."The script was praised within the industry,but the movie was not.<cite> Joss Whedon, createrr of Buffy</cite>
